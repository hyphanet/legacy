Freenet 0.5 and 0.6 are now in maintenance mode. All major 
development is occurring on 0.7. As a result, the previously 
incompatible 0.5 and 0.6 branches have been merged.

2. Introduction 
--------------- 
Fred (FREenet Daemon) is the reference Java implementation of the Freenet
Protocol.  Freenet is an architecture designed to permit true freedom of
communication over the Internet.  The system is designed to be used in
conjunction with one or more Freenet clients, and depending on the client,
can look like the World Wide Web, a Usenet server, or a file-sharing
application.  FProxy, a web interface to Freenet, is included.  See
http://freenetproject.org/ for more information (and source code if you
don't have it already).

This software was brought to you by the letter P, and several randomly
chosen large prime numbers.


3. Running Freenet 
----------------
3.1 Requirements 
----------------
Freenet requires a Java Runtime Environment to be installed prior to use.
Due to bugs in the current release version of Kaffe, and IBM's Java Runtime
Environment, we strongly suggest that you use the latest version of Sun's 
Java Runtime Environment for your platform (see http://java.sun.com/). If 
you want to use fproxy, we STRONGLY recommend you use a web browser that 
doesn't ignore MIME types... Mozilla and Konqueror are OK, Internet 
Explorer will seriously jeopardize your anonymity. Freenet also requires
that your system clock is within a few minutes of the actual time.

----------------------------
3.1.1 Dealing with firewalls
----------------------------
For a Freenet node to work correctly, other Freenet nodes must be able
to open connections to it, and normally NATs or Firewalls will prevent
this.

If you are behind a NAT or firewall you must do several things:

1) When Freenet asks you for your computer's IP address (ie. the
   ipAddress setting in the freenet.conf file), you should give the
   external address of your NAT or firewall. This will be under 
   "expert" because freenet can now auto-detect the IP address of
   most non-firewalled nodes.
2) After you have completed the steps in section 3.2, you should check
   the listenPort setting in your freenet.conf file.
3) Configure your NAT or firewall to forward incoming TCP connections
   on this port to your computer (see your NAT or firewall's manual
   for instructions on how to do this)

3.2 Starting Freenet
--------------------
On *NIX Type:
> sh start-freenet.sh 

To run Freenet.  The first time you run it it will ask you some questions 
to create a configuration file (freenet.conf).  You can edit this
manually later if you need to, but generally you shouldn't change
anything unless you know what you are doing.

3.3 Accessing Freenet via FProxy
--------------------------------
You can look at some websites in Freenet by visiting http://localhost:8888/
in your web browser.  You can also find interesting information about what
your node is doing there. Please read the SECURITY CAUTIONS below 
BEFORE using a Web Browser with Freenet


SETTING UP A BROWSER FOR BEST PERFORMANCE

---Mozilla and Gecko Based Browsers(ie. Netscape):
Many browsers limit the number of simultaneous connections to something far
too low for efficiently browsing Freenet (since Freenet pages often have
much higher latency than web pages). This can usually be reconfigured. For
example, for Mozilla post-1.3, go to about:config, and change the following
settings:

network.http.max-connections				200
network.http.max-connections-per-server			100
network.http.max-persistent-connections-per-server	10
network.http.max-persistent-connections-per-proxy	50

For Mozilla prior to 1.3: create a file with the following contents called
user.js in the directory with prefs.js, or append to an existing user.js:

user_pref("network.http.max-connections", 200);
user_pref("network.http.max-connections-per-server", 100);
user_pref("network.http.max-persistent-connections-per-server", 10);
user_pref("network.http.max-persistent-connections-per-proxy", 50);

Note that these settings will cause mozilla to use more connections for
all your browsing, which may not be desirable from a network congestion
point of view; volunteers to make mozilla allow this sort of settings to
be set per host would be welcome...

---Opera Browser
Go to File/Preferences/Network
- set 'Max connections to a server' to 20, 32 or 64,  if you find you are getting 
'could not connect to server' warnings adjust your setting one step down
- set ''Max total connections' to one setting higher than max connections, 
this will allow Freenet to use all connections available to it without interfering
with web browsing ie. if Max to server is 32 then Max total should be 64

Note that these settings will cause Opera to use more connections for
all your browsing, which may not be desirable from a network congestion
point of view


SECURITY CAUTIONS

---Mozilla and other Gecko-based browsers (i.e., Netscape, Firefox and
possibly Galeon and a few others):

The following is VERY IMPORTANT:

For Mozilla prior to 1.3: create a file with the following contents called
user.js in the same directory with prefs.js, or append to an existing user.js:

user_pref("browser.goBrowsing.enabled", false);

This disables Mozilla's default behaviour of feeding timed out
queries into Google, thus DESTROYING YOUR ANONYMITY.

In later versions of Mozilla, this setting can be edited within the program
itself by typing the URL "about:config" into the URL location box, 
right-clicking on "browser.goBrowsing.enabled" in the list of preferences
that comes up, selecting "Modify", and changing the setting from true to false.

---Microsoft Internet Explorer:
Internet Explorer (all versions, we think) has a totally different
ANONYMITY-DESTROYING BEHAVIOUR (not respecting MIME types), and also some 
problems with auto-detecting UTF16 even when we tell it in the headers to use 
some other charset). Internet Explorer is NOT recommended for 
anonymous browsing

---Opera Browser:
Opera's default behaviour is similar to Internet Explorer's and can compromise 
anonymity. Opera users MUST change the following setting to change this
ANONYMITY-DESTROYING BEHAVIOUR:

Go to File/Preferences/File types
- Click on 'Determine action by MIME type

---All Browsers:
It is possible that the anonymity filter can be circumvented by other means, so
if you care about your anonymity while browsing Freenet:
a) Don't use Internet Explorer and setup Opera properly, see above.
b) Turn off javascript, java, active scripting, and any other scripting your 
browser supports.
c) Set your browser to only load images, frames, etc from the server that 
originated the web page
d) Be extra paranoid! Keep your browser up to date etc. Extreme measures include 
browser proxies that block everything except localhost:8888 HTTP, encrypted disk
partitions or virtual disks, and so on.
e) Set in your config file:
mainport.params.servlet.1.params.filterParanoidStringCheck=true
mainport.params.servlet.7.params.sfFilterParanoidStringCheck=true
f) Consider using your operating system's security features to sandbox your 
Freenet browsing. For example, on Linux, you can (after setting 
httpInserts=false and fcpInserts=false in your freenet.conf) create a user 
specifically for browsing freenet, only use that user to browse freenet, and
type the following lines to prevent that user from accessing the regular 
internet (assuming the safe user, which must not be the user running the node,
is called "freenet"):

# Accept TCP packets destined for local ports 8888 and 8481.
iptables -A OUTPUT -d localhost -p tcp --dport 8888 -m owner --uid-owner freenet -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -d localhost -p tcp --dport 8481 -m owner --uid-owner freenet -j ACCEPT

# Drop everything else.
iptables -A OUTPUT -m owner --uid-owner freenet -j DROP

Your kernel must be configured with these options:

	CONFIG_IP_NF_IPTABLES
	CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_OWNER
	CONFIG_IP_NF_FILTER

Verify that the filter rules have been added:

$ iptables -L OUTPUT
Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination
ACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             localhost          OWNER UID match freenet tcp dpt:8888
ACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             localhost          OWNER UID match freenet tcp dpt:8481
DROP       all  --  anywhere             anywhere           OWNER UID match freenet

g) If you are accessing files that will get you into serious trouble, consider
using something simpler than a web browser to access Freenet... or better yet,
DON'T DO IT! This is still beta software, it probably has more bugs. Having 
said that, millions of people access questionable content through much less 
secure systems than Freenet. Use your common sense. You can't conceal the fact
that you are running a freenet node from a determined attacker, because of the
way Freenet works (path shortening - for more details visit our web site). 
However short of compromizing your computer, other expensive forms of 
surveillance, you doing something stupid, or more bugs, it should be very 
difficult for them to find out _what_ you browse (or publish) on Freenet.

What you want to prevent (in parts a,b,c) is freesites accessing the Real 
Internet, and giving away the combination of your IP address along and the
fact that you visited a given freesite or downloaded (or uploaded) a specific
file. This is called a Web Bug, and the simplest form is an image in a 
freesite loaded from somewhere on the real web - this gives away your IP 
address, and the page you are browsing (if the attacker is clever, or you have
Referer: turned on), to the server the image is downloaded from. Fproxy 
(freenet's web interface) contains code ("the anonymity filter") to try to
warn about or remove such things, but there could always be bugs in freenet or
in your web browser that would let something through. You can of course reduce
the likelihood of this by turning off images support in your browser.

The following formats are known to be able to carry data that could compromize your
anonymity (but there are no doubt many more that can do this):

* RealPlayer
* Windows Media Player
* MP3s (some id3 tags cause winamp to open web sites and thus compromize your anonymity)
* HTML and CSS, of course, hence the filter.

Finally, you should disable your browser cache AND set the option mainport.params.servlet.1.params.noCache=true in your config file (to tell freenet to send no-cache directives to the browser).

FILTER ISSUES FOR CONTENT AUTHORS
---------------------------------

Things to bear in mind when inserting HTML content/freesites:

* The new filter is VERY fussy about quote marks. Something like:
  <img src="something.png" width="95" height="32" alt="grey cat" align="left" "hspace="5">
  or
  <IMG SRC="../../../Blah/2//issue.png"" ALT="Issue 2" WIDTH=95 HEIGHT=32>
  will confuse it... this is partly because the HTML 4.01 spec seems to imply that <> 
  characters are allowed in strings inside tags. This should not be a problem using GUI
  tools; it is however a problem if you write the HTML directly.
* Charsets. If you want to insert a file with a charset other than the default iso-8859-1,
  tell your insertion tool to use the new charset in the mime type, for example 
  "text/html;charset=UTF16". The META tag to set the mime type is NOT supported. Neither
  is the UTF16 byte order mark.
* All unrecognized HTML tags are removed by fproxy, for security reasons.

JVM ISSUES
----------

There are issues with lots of JVMs.
* RedHat 9.0 and other distributions having Native Posix Threads are 
  _very_ unstable. That's why the startup script has been modified to 
  disable NPTL on Redhat; if you are using different distribution and you 
  know or suspect that it is with NPTL, try seting LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.2.5. 
  If this causes Freenet to fail to load with a library error, try 2.4.1, 
  but 2.4.1 will not work with the 1.4.2 JRE at the time of writing. 
  Hence, Gentoo requires the JRE to be Sun 1.4.1, not 1.4.2. :<
* Beta versions of Sun 1.4 don't work; 1.4.1r01 seems to work OK; 1.4.0 won't
  work due to significant changes to NIO made between 1.4.0 and 1.4.1
* Even under the Sun JVM, we have numerous reports of the -server VM causing
  wierd crashes. It has therefore been disabled in start-freenet.sh.
* Sun-derived JDKs (Sun, Blackdown, IBM etc) prior to 1.4 do not work.
* There are reports of exceptions on Blackdown that don't occur on Sun.
* Kaffe 1.0.6 and prior do not work at all.
* Kaffe 1.1 (possibly from CVS) will probably work, although it has a
  few issues:
    * Automatic detection of IP addresses is only done once at startup, so if
      your IP address changes often, you will need to restart your node often.
    * Mysteriously long delays acquiring locks and in other parts of the code
      that can make the node think it is overloaded.
* If you use Kaffe to run it, and you are not just using the provided JARs,
  which _will_ work with Kaffe, you need a compiler. Jikes 1.14 works. Jikes 
  1.15 and 1.16 at least don't work. Recent Jikes 1.18 CVS seems to work.
* If you run on MacOS/X, there is a default file descriptor limit of 256. 
  So Freenet uses a default connection limit of 128 if OS/X is detected, as 
  it uses fds for many things other than connections). You will probably be
  able to raise the limit with the command ulimit -n 1024, and then set
  maxNodeConnections=512 explicitly in the config file. Most other unix(tm)
  derived systems have a default limit of 1024, so they are ok (the default
  512 connections should be plenty for most purposes).

TWEAKING
--------

1. How To Speed Up Large Splitfiles
-----------------------------------

You can speed up splitfiles (FEC encoded splitfiles, the default), by using
native compiled FEC libraries.

Details are at this URL:
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/freenet/Contrib/fecimpl/onion/README?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup
(that is fecimpl/onion/README in the freenet Contrib CVS module),

The info on Native FEC support on the Nubile freesite (edition 11) is completly obsolete.

The zip file that the readme refers to is in CVS (in the Contrib module,
*not* the main freenet module).

You can access it on the web here:

http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/freenet/Contrib/fecimpl/onion/alien/fec-1.0.3.zip

(Do a "Save link as..."  on the "(download)" link from your browser)

I didn't deploy native FEC support by default because I didn't want to deal
with the per platform configuration issues.   The instructions in the file
given above are geared toward people who already know about JNI libraries.

If someone out there wants to write per platform (*nix, Windows) end user
install doc, suitable for inclusion in the generic Freenet README, that would
be a valuable contribution to the project.
