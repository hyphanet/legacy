Presumably this post belongs in the tech section, but I didn't see much except SPAM in the archives. Didn't see
+anything like it in the devl archives either, so here goes.

This is about HTL 25 and identification of the nodes inserting and requesting informations. To achieve maximum
+reach, most programs will increase the HTL on both gets and inserts to 25 if needed. The problem with this is
+that this also means the node using that is also the originating node, since the default HTL max limit is 25,
+and so any neighbouring node could monitor them. I wonder whether this problem could be solved by not making
+HTLs absolute, but rather probabilistic. This means that a server will decrease HTL with 1 with a probability
+p%, or pass it on with same HTL with probability (1-p%). In fact, I'd consider it a good thing for the entire
+HTL system as it makes nothing certain about the number of hops to or from anything, making trafic analysis
+difficult. However, to keep it from being too varying, it should be less and less likely the lower the HTL.
+I've played around a bit with the numbers in Excel with @RISK and came up with a TTL (time to live) formula
+that g
 ives results like this:

New      Old    (5%th-95%th percentile)
TTL  5 = HTL  5 (HTL05-05)
TTL 10 = HTL 10 (HTL10-11)
TTL 15 = HTL 16 (HTL15-18)
TTL 20 = HTL 25 (HTL21-29)

Chance that a TTL20 insert/get is the original inserter/requester: 47%
Chance that a TTL19 insert/get is next to inserter: 22%

Tranlation: Finding the original inserter will be a really big bitch.

Pseudocode: IF(OldTTL^3/15000 < RAND()) THEN NewTTL = OldTTL ELSE NewTTL = OldTTL-1, where RAND() is a random
+number between 0 and 1.

Potentially, the transition could be fairly easy, if the new nodes simply reduce HTL > 20 to TTL 20 and pass it
+on. while old nodes use the same as HTL. In a worst case scenario, you lose 5 hops HTL 25 -> TTL 20 -> HTL
+again (or gain 5, if you get both HTL 25->20 + TTL hops).

My java knowledge is less than stunning, but I think the idea is sound and the numbers good. Let me know what
+you other people think, and if you are interested. I could try to implement it myself, but I'd probably
+introdouce a dozen Heisenbugs in the process, so suggest that at your own risk :)

Actually, it needs to have an increasing probability for really low HTLs
to avoid node probing. We currently have a 30% or so chance of not
decrementing the HTL at 1, which rapidly tails off and is insignificant
when you get to the starter HTLs you are talking about.

Also, the HTL of queries is randomized a bit before they are started in
the current codebase - a request at HTL 25 may end up as HTL 22.

The problem is that sometimes people download large bunches of files
at once, e.g. splitfiles or large freesites, so the attacker will be
able to do statistical attacks. The solution is something called premix
routing, where we use something resembling mixmaster so that the first
two hops are random, the first hop knows the originator of the request
but not the key, and the second knows the key but not the originator.

Hi!

First things first, I didn't want to sign up my Uni
email for mailing lists (it gets enough crap as it is)
but I'm the same as kjellrs(at)stud.ntnu.no

The node probing problems sounds like the exact
opposite of the insertion problem. However, I couldn't
figure out where in the code this was, and it would
give me the correct numbers (variance in start +
variance in end = total variance?). I did find the
standard reduction by (at least, didn't get the 'at
least' part) 1 in
freenet/node/states/request/Pending.java, but not the
formula you're referring to. I guess I'll keep
digging.

If I understand this correctly, that would be the
perturbHTL in Node.java. It would appear to be at most
?2, but the biggest problem is still that a maxHTL of
25 is a smoking gun, since no other node would send
out a maxHTL of 25. In fact, it could turn requests at
23 and 24 into maxHTL 25, turning them into smoking
guns. A little mix and match of this idea and mine
could prove useful though and could improve on my
solution, but I still need to find that low-end HTL
code.

I looked into it and I have one problem in
understanding premix routing. In order to encrypt it
with the public key of the second node, you must have
some way of knowing this key. However, you can not go
through the first node, obviously, as that one can
simply claim to give you this key, while in reality
faking it and decrypt both first and second part
itself. Going through any other node means that you
are completely dependent on the existance of a route
between those two specific hosts, which is close to
impossible on Freenet. I suppose that works for
Mixmaster and TCP/IP, but I don't see it working very
well over the Freenet protocol.

Subject: [freenet-dev] HTL system - java code...

Here's working code of a better and more anonymous HTL
system, at least for small sample sizes (I'd say <
5mb). If anyone is trying to share an ISO through
Freenet, I don't think it's possible to protect their 
anonymity no matter what.

Since I haven't got anything but anon CVS access yet,
and I'm sure you all love attachments on mailing
lists,  I put the two changed files up on
http://stud.ntnu.no/~kjellrs/freenet.html as well as
some graphs indicating what exactly these changes will
do. I could post you the simulation files, but they'd
be useless without the commercial simulation package
(got Students Edition with a book).

As for the Java code, well it compiles. I'm trying to
do some debugging but can't seem to get it started. Is
there anything more I should do than to replace the
old jar with the one I built? Getting ERROR): Failed
to load service: mainport, and I'm pretty damn sure I
haven't been messing with any services...

Kjella is wrong. We can protect big splitfile downloads IMHO, as long as
we implement a pre-routing mixnet stage. - amphibian
